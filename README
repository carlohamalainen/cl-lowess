This is a stand-alone rip of the lowess.c file from the common-lisp-stat project:
https://github.com/blindglobe/common-lisp-stat/blob/master/lib/lowess.c
It implements the LOWESS algorithm of W. S. Cleveland as obtained from NETLIB.

My contribution is solely the Common Lisp wrapper and a few minor edits to make 
it work in a stand-alone manner.

To compile the C file:

    make

To run the test script (assumes that you have Python and matplotlib installed):

    sbcl  --noinform --load test-lowess.lisp | python

Example output is in example-output-from-test-script.png.
